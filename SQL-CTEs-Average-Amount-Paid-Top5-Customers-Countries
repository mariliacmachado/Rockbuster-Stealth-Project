I performed the following SQL CTEs in order to find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers and how many are based within each country.

WITH top_10_countries AS
(SELECT
A.customer_id,
A.first_name,
A.last_name,
D.country,
C.city,
SUM(E.amount) AS total_spent
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE C.city IN (SELECT top_10_cities FROM top_5_customers_list)
GROUP BY
A.customer_id,
A.first_name,
A.last_name,
D.country,
C.city),
top_5_customers AS
(SELECT
customer_id,
first_name,
last_name,
country,
city,
total_spent
FROM top_10_countries
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT AVG(total_spent) AS average
FROM top_5_customers;
