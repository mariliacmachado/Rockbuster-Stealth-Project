## Project Summary
This project was completed as part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program and showcases the use of SQL for business data analysis. The analysis supported the launch strategy for Rockbuster Stealth's online video rental service by extracting actionable insights from a relational database. Deliverables included SQL scripts, visualizations, and recommendations to guide the management team's strategic decisions.

## Objectives
- Evaluate movie revenue contributions to identify high- and low-performing titles.
- Determine average rental durations to optimize inventory management.
- Analyze the geographic distribution of customers and locate high-value segments.
- Compare sales performance across different regions to uncover trends.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Writing complex SQL queries for data extraction and analysis.
- Performing data cleaning, summarization, and transformation within a relational database.
- Creating clear and compelling visualizations to communicate findings.
- Presenting actionable insights to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Key Deliverables
- SQL scripts answering critical business questions.
- Data visualizations summarizing customer behavior and sales trends.
- A comprehensive report with strategic recommendations for the management board.
