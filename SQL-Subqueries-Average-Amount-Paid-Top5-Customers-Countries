These are several subqueries to find out the average amount paid by the top 5 customers and how many of those customers are based within each country.

SELECT AVG(total_spent) AS average FROM
(SELECT A.customer_id,
A.first_name,

FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id

INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
WHERE C.city IN (SELECT top_10_cities FROM top_5_customers_list)
GROUP BY A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, D.country, C.city
ORDER BY SUM(E.amount) DESC
LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid;
