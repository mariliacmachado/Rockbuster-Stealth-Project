In this specific project, I checked for duplicates using these SQL queries:
SELECT title, release_year, language_id, rental_duration,
COUNT (*)
FROM film
GROUP BY title, release_year, language_id, rental_duration
HAVING COUNT(*) >1;

SELECT email, first_name, last_name, create_date,
COUNT(*)
FROM customer
GROUP BY email, first_name, last_name, create_date
HAVING COUNT(*) >1;

There were no duplicates, but if there were, I would perform the following queries to clean the tables:

CREATE VIEW film_unique_records_view AS
SELECT * FROM film
CREATE VIEW customer_unique_records_view AS
SELECT * FROM customer

DELETE FROM film
WHERE film_id NOT IN (SELECT MIN(film_id)
FROM film
GROUP BY rental_duration, language_id, title, release_year)

DELETE FROM customer
WHERE customer_id NOT IN (SELECT MIN(customer_id)
FROM customer
GROUP BY email, first_name, last_name, create_date)
